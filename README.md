# 1D-STEADY-CONDUCTION-HEAT-TRANSFER-CASE-IN-CYLINDRICAL-WALLS
In this analysis, we have examined the temperature trend of a hollow cylinder of Carbon steel with an internal radius Rint, external radius Rext and height H by implementing a simulation of a steady, 1D conduction heat transfer by using numerical methods.
